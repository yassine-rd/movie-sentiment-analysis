"""
A simple machine learning application to predict the sentiment of a movie review.

This script loads a trained sentiment classification model and uses it to predict
the sentiment of a movie review entered by the user. The user interface is built using
Streamlit, and includes a form to receive the review text and a button to trigger the
prediction.

The script uses text preprocessing techniques, such as removing stop words and lemmatizing
words, to clean the input text before making the prediction. The cleaned text is then passed
to the model, which predicts whether the sentiment of the review is positive or negative.
The predicted sentiment and its probability are then displayed to the user.

    remove_stop_words (bool, optional): If True, removes stop words from the input text. Defaults to True.
