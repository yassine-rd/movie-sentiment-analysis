# Movie Sentiment Analysis: A Multinomial Naïve Bayes-Based Approach for Assessing User and Critic Opinions

## ✨ Abstract

The growing volume of user-generated content, particu- larly in the form of movie reviews, presents both challenges and opportunities for researchers and practitioners in the movie industry. Movie sentiment analysis has emerged as a vital tool to automatically process and interpret this vast repository of data, offering valuable insights into viewer preferences and opinions.

## 🎬 About the Project

In this project, we involve a comprehensive study of relevant NLP techniques, including data pre-processing, feature extraction, and model selection.

The chosen Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm will be trained and optimized on a dataset of user critic reviews, with model performance evaluated based on multiple evaluation metrics.

Deployed [here](https://movie-sentiment.streamlit.app/).
